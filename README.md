Word Search - Java
Steven Combs

To build the project use either

	gradle build 

if gradle has been installed or else use

	./gradlew build

if gradle has not been installed. 


To pass a list of words and a grid into the wordsearch progam after the above build command has been ran, execute the runWordSearch.sh script passing in the full filepath of the file that is to be processed. 

IE: 

./runWordSeach.sh testData/secondTest.txt
